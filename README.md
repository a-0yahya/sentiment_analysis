# Sentiment Analysis Using R

Welcome to the **Sentiment Analysis Using R** project! This repository demonstrates how to build a sentiment analysis model using **R programming** and the `tidytext` package. The goal is to analyze text data, assign sentiment scores to words, and classify them based on their polarity (positive, negative, or neutral). This project provides a comprehensive guide, from data preprocessing to the visualization of sentiment results.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Converts text to lower case, removes punctuation, and eliminates stopwords.
- **Sentiment Scoring**: Uses lexicons from the `tidytext` package to assign polarity scores.
- **Visualization**: Displays results using graphical tools such as bar charts and word clouds.
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt the code for different datasets or languages.
